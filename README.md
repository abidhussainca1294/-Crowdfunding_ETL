# -Crowdfunding_ETL
An ETL pipeline is developed using Python, Pandas, both Python dictionary methods and regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After transforming the data, four CSV files are created and are used to create an Entity Relationship Diagram(ERD) and a table schema. Finally, the CSV file data a re uploaded into a Postgres database.

Project Outline:
A relational (SQL) database is the final product to be used for the production environment. Data extraction and transformation is performed using python with the following packages: pandas, numpy and date time. The cleaned data is loaded into the relational database using pgAdmin for storage and management.
Free tool QuickDBD ( https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/ ) is used for data modelling by sketching an Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables.
